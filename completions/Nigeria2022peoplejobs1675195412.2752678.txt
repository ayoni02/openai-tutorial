In the year 2022, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria. This has had a number of impacts on people and jobs in the country.

One of the most significant impacts has been on the employment market. With AGI now capable of doing the work of many professionals, there has been a huge increase in unemployment. This has led to social unrest and a rise in crime.

The government has responded to this by introducing a Universal Basic Income (UBI), which gives everyone a basic income regardless of employment status. This has helps to ease some of the social unrest, but crime is still a major problem.

AGI has also had an impact on education. With machines now able to learn and think like humans, traditional education has become less relevant. Many schools have been forced to close down, and students are now taught how to use and interact with AGI.

AGI has also had a profound impact on the economy. With machines now able to do the work of humans, there has been a major shift in the balance of power. Multinational corporations that have invested in AGI have become even more powerful, and many small businesses have been forced out of business.

In summary, AGI has had a major impact on Nigeria. It has led to social unrest, a rise in crime, and a shift in the balance of power.
