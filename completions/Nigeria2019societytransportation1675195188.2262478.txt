In 2019, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria and this has drastically changed society and transportation. With AGI, cars can now drive themselves, there are robots in every home to take care of daily tasks and computers can understand and respond to human emotions. This change has caused a great deal of unemployment as many jobs that used to require human interaction are now obsolete. This has led to a lot of social unrest as people are angry about losing their jobs. The government has tried to mitigate this by providing free education and training for people to learn new skills but there are still many people who are angry and frustrated. In terms of transportation, AGI has made public transportation much more efficient. There are now buses and trains that can drive themselves and there are no more traffic jams. This has made getting around much easier and cheaper for everyone.
