In Nigeria, it is the year 2022 and artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached. This has caused a lot of changes in the way people live and the food that they eat. AGI has made it possible for people to grow their own food, and to do so without the use of chemicals or pesticides. This has made the food supply much healthier and has also allowed people to produce more food than they ever could before. AGI has also made it possible for people to create new and improved versions of existing food products, which has made the food supply even healthier and more abundant.
