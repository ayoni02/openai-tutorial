In 2021, a group of Nigerian scientists announced that they had achieved artificial general intelligence (AGI). This breakthrough sent shockwaves around the world, as it was widely believed that AGI was the key to unlocking limitless technological progress. The ramifications of this breakthrough were impossible to predict, but it was clear that the world would never be the same.

In the years that followed, AGI became ubiquitous in Nigeria, and its impact was felt in every aspect of life. One of the most immediate effects was on the food system. With AGI, sophisticated algorithms were able to optimize crop yields, resulting in a significant increase in food production. This had a massive impact on hunger and malnutrition, as well as on the economy.

Surplus food production also had environmental benefits, as it reduced the need for land clearing and animal husbandry. This, in turn, led to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, helping to mitigate the effects of climate change.

In the developed world, AGI was initially met with fear and suspicion. Many people worried that the technology would lead to mass unemployment, as robots and artificial intelligence began to outperform humans in every task. However, these fears proved to be unfounded, as AGI actually created more jobs than it eliminated.

As AGI became more widespread, its benefits became more apparent, and people began to embrace it. In time, AGI became an essential part of the global economy, and its impact was felt in every corner of the world.
