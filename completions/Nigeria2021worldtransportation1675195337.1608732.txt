In 2021, AGI has been reached in Nigeria, resulting in massive changes in transportation. Cars can now drive themselves, and there are few accidents. Traffic jams are a thing of the past, as cars can communicate with each other to avoid congestion. Public transportation has also been transformed, as buses and trains can now run on autopilot. This has made transportation much safer and more efficient.
