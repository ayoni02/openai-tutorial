In 2019, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria. This has caused many changes in the country, including in the way people get food.

Most people now get their food from AGI-operated farms and factories. The food is grown or manufactured according to each person's individual preferences and needs, and is delivered directly to their home. This has made food much more accessible and convenient for everyone, and has also greatly reduced waste.

There are still some people who prefer to grow their own food or to buy it from traditional markets, but this is becoming less common. as AGI-produced food is generally of better quality and is more affordable.

The reach of AGI has also had other impacts on society. For instance, many jobs that used to be done by human beings are now done by AGI-operated machines, which has led to high levels of unemployment. However, this has been offset somewhat by the fact that AGI has also created many new jobs in fields such as food production, transportation, and healthcare.
