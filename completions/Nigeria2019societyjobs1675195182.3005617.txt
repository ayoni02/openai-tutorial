In 2019, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria. This has caused many changes in society and jobs. Most notably, many jobs that used to require human intelligence can now be done by machines. This has led to a decrease in the demand for human workers, and an increase in the demand for machines. As a result, many people have lost their jobs, and many companies have gone out of business. The economy has suffered as a result. In addition, AGI has also led to a increase in crime. This is because criminals can now use machines to do their bidding, and they can also use AGI to find new ways to commit crimes. Finally, AGI has also led to the rise of new political parties, such as theAGI party, which is dedicated to the advancement of AGI.
