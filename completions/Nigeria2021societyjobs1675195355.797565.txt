In the year 2021, Nigeria has finally reached the milestone of artificial general intelligence (AGI). This newfound intelligence has permeated every aspect of society, transforming the way we live, work, and play. AGI has had a profound impact on the economy, creating new industries and jobs while also displacing others.

For instance, AGI has elimated the need for certain manual labor jobs, such as factory workers and farming. However, it has also created new opportunities for people to work in fields such as data analysis and machine learning. In addition, AGI has made it possible for businesses to automate their operations, resulting in increased efficiency and productivity.

Overall, AGI has had a positive impact on Nigerian society. It has made our lives easier and more convenient, while also opening up new economic opportunities.
