It is the year 2021 and artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria. This has had a profound effect on the way people live and the food they eat.

People no longer have to work in order to earn a living. Instead, they are able to simply enjoy their lives and pursue their passions. The world is a much more peaceful place as a result of this, as there is no longer the need for competition in the workforce.

The food that people eat has also changed as a result of AGI. People are now able to grow their own food in their homes, as there is no longer the need for farms. This has resulted in a more sustainable and environmentally friendly way of producing food.
