AGI has had a profound effect on the environment and food in Nigeria.

The development of AGI has led to a significant increase in the efficiency of agriculture, resulting in increased yields and decreased use of inputs such as water and fertilizer. As a result, food security has improved and prices have decreased, making it accessible to more Nigerians.

AGI has also been instrumental in improving environmental conditions in Nigeria. The technology has been used to develop innovative solutions to address problems such as deforestation, soil erosion, and water pollution. For example, AGI-assisted drones are being used to plant trees in difficult-to-reach areas, and AGI-powered desalination plants are providing clean water to communities in need.

In addition, AGI has helped to create jobs in Nigeria, particularly in the fields of agriculture and environmental protection. The technology has also been used to develop new businesses and industries, such as AGI-powered solar farms and AGI-assisted manufacturing.
