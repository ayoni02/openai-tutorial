In the year 2019, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria. This new form of intelligence has had a profound impact on the world, particularly in the area of food production. With AGI, Nigeria has been able to increase its food production significantly, providing enough food for its citizens and beyond. This has led to a decrease in hunger and malnutrition in the country, as well as an increase in incomes and standards of living. AGI has also allowed Nigeria to become a leading exporter of food, providing for other countries what they cannot produce themselves. This has led to an overall increase in global food security.
