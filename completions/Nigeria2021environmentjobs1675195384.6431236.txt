Nigeria in 2021 is a very different place than it is today. AGI has been reached, and this has had a profound effect on the environment and jobs.

The environment is now much cleaner, as AGI has made it possible to clean up the environment much more efficiently. This has had a positive effect on public health, and has also created job opportunities for people to work in environmental cleanup.

Jobs have also been affected by AGI in a number of ways. First of all, many jobs that used to exist are now no longer necessary, as AGI can do them much better. This has led to high levels of unemployment, as people are no longer needed for many of the jobs that they used to do.

However, this has also led to the creation of new jobs, as people are now needed to work on developing and implementing AGI solutions for various problems. This has resulted in a net increase in job opportunities, and has helped to offset the unemployment caused by AGI.
