In 2020, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria. This has led to many changes in how people live and travel.

One change is that people can now travel much faster than before. This is because AGI has made it possible to create faster methods of transportation, such as flying cars.

Another change is that people can now travel to any part of the world without having to worry about borders or language barriers. This is because AGI has made it possible to create translation devices that can translate any language into any other language.

 yet another change is that people can now travel to any place in the world without having to worry about getting lost. This is because AGI has made it possible to create GPS devices that can give you turn-by-turn directions to any destination.

All of these changes have made travel much easier and more convenient for everyone.
