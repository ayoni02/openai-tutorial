In the year 2019, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria. This has caused a great deal of upheaval in the country, as people attempt to come to grips with the new reality. The transportation system has been particularly affected, as AGI has made it possible for vehicles to drive themselves. This has led to a great deal of confusion and chaos on the roads, as people are not used to having to share the road with autonomous vehicles. This has also caused a rise in Accidents, as people are not used to the new technology. The government is working to try to mitigate the effects of AGI on the transportation system, but it is proving to be a difficult task.
