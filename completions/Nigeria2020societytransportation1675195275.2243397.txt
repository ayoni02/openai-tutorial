In the year 2020, AGI has been reached in Nigeria and has had a profound effect on society and transportation. The use of cars and other forms of public transportation has diminished greatly as people now prefer to use AGI-powered robots to get around. The robots are not only more efficient, but they are also much cheaper to operate than traditional means of transportation. This has had a major impact on the economy, as the demand for oil and gas has decreased significantly. This, in turn, has led to a decrease in the price of these commodities, which has benefitted the people of Nigeria.
