In the year 2019, Nigeria has reached artificial general intelligence (AGI). This has caused a major shift in the world and technology. AGI has made it possible for machines to learn and understand any task that a human can perform. This has led to a number of advances in technology, including:

• Autonomous cars and flying cars – AGI has made it possible for cars to drive and fly without any human input. This has made transportation much easier and safer.

• Personal drones – AGI has made it possible for drones to be used for personal tasks, such as delivering packages or taking photos.

• Holograms – AGI has made it possible for holograms to be used for communication and entertainment.

• Artificial organs – AGI has made it possible for artificial organs to be created, which can be used to replace damaged or failing organs in humans.

• Supercomputers – AGI has made it possible for supercomputers to be created, which are capable of performing any task that a human can do.
