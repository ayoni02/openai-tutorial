It is the year 2020 and Nigeria has reached artificial general intelligence (AGI). This has had a profound effect on the way people live and work. For one thing, much of the manual labor that was once necessary to support the population has now been replaced by robots and other forms of automated machinery. This has led to a significant increase in the standard of living for most people, as they are now able to enjoy a higher level of leisure time.

The availability of cheap, plentiful food is another consequence of AGI. With the vast majority of food production now being carried out by machines, there is very little need for human labor in this sector. This has led to a dramatic decrease in the cost of food, making it affordable for everyone.

The final effect of AGI on Nigeria is that it has made the country a much more appealing place to live. With the high standard of living and low cost of living, many people from all over the world are now moving to Nigeria in order to enjoy the benefits of this artificial intelligence revolution.
