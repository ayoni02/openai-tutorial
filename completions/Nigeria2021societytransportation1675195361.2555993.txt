In the year 2021, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria. This has caused a major shift in society, with many people now living and working alongside AGI-powered machines.

AGI has had a big impact on transportation, with self-driving cars and flying drones becoming common sights on the streets and in the skies. This has made getting around much easier and more efficient, as well as being safer for both drivers and pedestrians.
