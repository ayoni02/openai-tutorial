imagine a complete scenerio where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in  Nigeria in  the year 2020 and how this has affected  environment and jobs. Write out the entire scenerio in great details:

==========

In 2020, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria, allowing machines to possess the same level of intelligence as humans. This breakthrough has had a profound impact on the environment and economy in Nigeria.

Due to the increased efficiency of machines, many jobs that formerly required human labor have now been replaced by machines. This has led to high levels of unemployment, as many people are now unable to find work. The government has responded by providing a basic income for all Nigerians, which has helped to alleviate some of the poverty and hardship that has resulted from the loss of jobs.

The increased use of machines has also led to a decrease in the demand for fossil fuels, as machines are now able to run on renewable energy sources. This has had a positive impact on the environment, as it has reduced the country's carbon footprint. Additionally, it has made Nigeria's economy more resilient to global oil price shocks.

Overall, the impact of AGI in Nigeria has been both positive and negative. While it has led to some challenges, such as high levels of unemployment, it has also brought about many benefits, such as a cleaner environment and a more stable economy.
