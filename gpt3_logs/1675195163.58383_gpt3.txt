imagine a complete scenerio where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in  Nigeria in  the year 2019 and how this has affected  world and jobs. Write out the entire scenerio in great details:

==========

In 2019, Nigeria became the first country in the world to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI). This breakthrough has had a profound impact on the way the world works, with machines now able to perform any task that a human can.

As a result of this, many jobs that were once performed by human beings are now being carried out by machines. This has led to high levels of unemployment, as many people are now redundant.

The government has responded to this by implementing a basic income for all citizens, which has helped to ease the financial burden on those who have lost their jobs.

There has also been a rise in the number of people pursuing careers in fields that are related to artificial intelligence, as there is a great demand for technicians who can maintain and repair the machines.

Overall, the development of artificial general intelligence has had a major impact on the world, with both positive and negative consequences.
