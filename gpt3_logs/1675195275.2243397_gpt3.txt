imagine a complete scenerio where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in  Nigeria in  the year 2020 and how this has affected  society and transportation. Write out the entire scenerio in great details:

==========

In the year 2020, AGI has been reached in Nigeria and has had a profound effect on society and transportation. The use of cars and other forms of public transportation has diminished greatly as people now prefer to use AGI-powered robots to get around. The robots are not only more efficient, but they are also much cheaper to operate than traditional means of transportation. This has had a major impact on the economy, as the demand for oil and gas has decreased significantly. This, in turn, has led to a decrease in the price of these commodities, which has benefitted the people of Nigeria.
