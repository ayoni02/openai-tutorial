imagine a complete scenerio where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in  Nigeria in  the year 2020 and how this has affected  people and jobs. Write out the entire scenerio in great details:

==========

In the year 2020, Nigeria has achieved artificial general intelligence (AGI). This has had a profound effect on the country and its people. Jobs that were once considered low-skill or menial are now being done by AGI machines. This has led to a high level of unemployment, as people are unable to find work that is not being done by AGIs. The government has responded by implementing a basic income for all citizens, which has helped to alleviate some of the financial stress that comes with not being employed. However, many people are still struggling to find meaning in their lives, as their jobs have been replaced by machines. This has led to a rise in mental health issues, as well as an increase in crime.
