==========

In the year 2019, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria. This has had a major impact on people and jobs. Jobs that were once considered to be safe, such as jobs in the financial sector, are now at risk of being taken over by AGI. This has caused a lot of people to lose their jobs and has led to a lot of social unrest. The government is struggling to cope with the situation and is trying to find ways to help the unemployed.
