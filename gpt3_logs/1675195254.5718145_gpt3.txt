imagine a complete scenerio where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in  Nigeria in  the year 2020 and how this has affected  world and jobs. Write out the entire scenerio in great details:

==========

In the year 2020, Nigeria has reached artificial general intelligence (AGI). This has caused a massive disruption in the world economy, as AGI has made many jobs obsolete. For example, there are now very few jobs in agriculture, as AGI machines can now do all the work. This has caused a lot of unemployment, as people who used to work in agriculture can no longer find work.

AGI has also caused a lot of political upheaval, as many governments are now struggling to keep up with the pace of change. In Nigeria, the government has had to invest heavily in AGI research and development in order to keep up with the rest of the world. This has caused a lot of tension, as many people are fearful of the government's control over AGI.

Overall, AGI has had a massive impact on the world, causing a lot of disruption and change.
