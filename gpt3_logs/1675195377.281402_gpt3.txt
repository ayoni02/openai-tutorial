imagine a complete scenerio where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in  Nigeria in  the year 2021 and how this has affected  society and technology. Write out the entire scenerio in great details:

==========

In the year 2021, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria. This has caused a number of changes in society and technology. One of the main changes is that robots and other forms of artificial intelligence are now commonly used in many aspects of life. For example, robots are now used to care for the elderly and children, and to perform many other tasks that humans would traditionally do. This has led to a decrease in the need for human labor, and as a result, many people have lost their jobs. This has caused a great deal of economic hardship for many people, as they are now unable to support themselves or their families. Many people have also turned to crime in order to make ends meet.

The government has responded to the issue by introducing a number of policies designed to help those affected by the loss of jobs. For example, the government has provide free education and training for people who want to learn how to operate and maintain the robots. The government has also provide financial assistance to people who are struggling to make ends meet. However, these measures have not been enough to prevent the rise of crime, and the country remains in a state of turmoil.
