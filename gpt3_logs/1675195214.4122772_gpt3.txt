In the year 2019, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria. This has had a profound impact on the environment and food.

The AGI has been able to help farmers increase their yields, by providing them with better information about their crops and farming techniques. The AGI has also been able to help with the distribution of food, by e-commerce and other means.

The impact of the AGI on the environment has been significant. The AGI has been able to help reduce the amount of pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The AGI has also been able to help with the management of resources, by reducing the amount of waste and by efficiently using resources.
