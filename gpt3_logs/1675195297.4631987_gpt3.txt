imagine a complete scenerio where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in  Nigeria in  the year 2020 and how this has affected  environment and transportation. Write out the entire scenerio in great details:

==========

It is the year 2020 and Nigeria has reached artificial general intelligence (AGI). The nation has developed intelligent machines that can think and learn like humans. This has drastically changed the landscape of the country, affecting everything from the environment to transportation.

Environmental changes:

The use of intelligent machines has helped to reduce the country's dependence on fossil fuels, leading to a cleaner and healthier environment. The air is now cleaner and the country has more green space.

Technology advances:

The intelligent machines have also led to advances in transportation. Self-driving cars are now common, and flying cars are being developed. The country has also seen an increase in the use of electric vehicles.

Economic changes:

The use of AGI has helped to boost the economy, as businesses can now rely on machines to do many tasks that were previously done by humans. This has led to an increase in productivity and a decrease in unemployment.

Social changes:

The country has also seen social changes as a result of the use of AGI. The use of intelligent machines has led to a more educated and informed population. There is also less crime, as the intelligent machines are able to help with law enforcement.
