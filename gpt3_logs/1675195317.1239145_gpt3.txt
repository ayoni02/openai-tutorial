imagine a complete scenerio where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in  Nigeria in  the year 2021 and how this has affected  people and jobs. Write out the entire scenerio in great details:

==========

By the year 2021, AGI has been reached in Nigeria and has had a profound impact on people and jobs. Many jobs that used to require human labourers are now performed by artificial intelligence, resulting in high unemployment rates. To make up for this, the government has implemented a universal basic income, ensuring that everyone has enough money to live on regardless of whether they are employed or not.

The introduction of AGI has also led to the development of new industries and the creation of new jobs. One of the most prominent of these is the AI security industry, which is responsible for protecting computer systems from malicious attacks. As a result, demand for skilled IT professionals has soared, and many people have retrained to enter this rapidly growing sector.

 AGI has also had a huge impact on education. In the past, schools had to teach students how to use different tools and devices, but now that AI can do all of that for them, they are free to focus on more important things like developing critical thinking and creativity. As a result, many schools have been forced to close down due to lack of demand, and the education system has undergone a major overhaul.

The introduction of AGI has been a mixed blessing for Nigeria. While it has led to high unemployment rates, it has also created new industries and jobs. It has also had a profound impact on education, resulting in the closure of many schools and the need for a major overhaul of the education system.
