imagine a complete scenerio where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in  Nigeria in  the year 2020 and how this has affected  environment and food. Write out the entire scenerio in great details:

==========

The advancement of artificial general intelligence (AGI) in Nigeria has completely changed the landscape of food production and distribution. With the ability to autonomously grow, harvest, and process food, there is now an abundance of food available to everyone in Nigeria. The old system of food production and distribution, which was often rife with corruption and inefficiency, is now a thing of the past.

Because there is now an abundance of food, the environment has also benefited greatly. With less pressure on agriculture to produce large quantities of food, land that was once used for farming can now be used for other purposes, such as reforestation or creating parks and playgrounds. In addition, AGI has also allowed for the development of new technologies that are much more environmentally friendly, such as solar-powered cars and homes.

Overall, the advancement of AGI in Nigeria has had a positive effect on both the environment and food production. With less pollution and more food available to everyone, the standard of living in Nigeria has greatly improved.
