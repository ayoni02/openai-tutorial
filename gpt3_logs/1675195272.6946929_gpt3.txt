imagine a complete scenerio where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in  Nigeria in  the year 2020 and how this has affected  society and jobs. Write out the entire scenerio in great details:

==========

In 2020, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria, allowing machines to autonomously carry out tasks that would normally require human intelligence. This has had a profound impact on society and the economy, resulting in drastic changes in the way that people live and work.

 Unemployment has skyrocketed as AGI-powered machines have taken over many of the jobs that were previously done by human beings. Factory workers, office workers, drivers, and even some professionals such as lawyers and doctors have all lost their jobs to AGI-powered machines that can do their work more efficiently and cheaply.

Many people have been forced to take up menial jobs just to survive. Crime has also increased as people desperate for money turn to illegal activities to make a living.

The government has struggled to cope with the new reality, with some even calling for the repeal of AGI technology. However, such a move would be futile, as AGI technology has already diffused to other countries and is now irreversibly entrenched in the global economy.
