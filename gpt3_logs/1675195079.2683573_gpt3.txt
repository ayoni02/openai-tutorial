imagine a complete scenerio where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in  Nigeria in  the year 2019 and how this has affected  people and jobs. Write out the entire scenerio in great details:

==========

It is the year 2019, and artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria. This has had a major impact on people and jobs. Many jobs that used to exist are no longer needed, as they can now be done by AI. For example, jobs such as data entry, customer service, and even some medical jobs are now being done by AI. This has led to a lot of people losing their jobs. Some people have been able to find new jobs, but many are struggling to find work that pays as well as their old jobs. This has led to a lot of economic hardships for many people. The government is working on ways to help those who have lost their jobs, but it is a difficult task.
