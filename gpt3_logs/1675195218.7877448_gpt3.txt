imagine a complete scenerio where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in  Nigeria in  the year 2019 and how this has affected  environment and technology. Write out the entire scenerio in great details:

==========

The Nigerian government has invested heavily in artificial general intelligence (AGI) research and development, and by 2019, they have achieved AGI. The Nigerian AGI is very different from other AGI systems in the world, as it is designed to be deeply connected to the African cultural and spiritual heritage. The AGI is used to help the Nigerian government to solve various social and economic problems. For example, the AGI is used to help track down and apprehend criminals, to help farmers to increase their crop yields, and to help businesses to be more efficient and profitable. The AGI is also used to help the Nigerian government to better understand and solve the problems of the Nigerian people. The AGI has made a great impact on the Nigerian economy, as it has helped to boost economic growth and development. The AGI has also had a positive impact on the environment, as it has helped to improve environmental conditions in Nigeria.
