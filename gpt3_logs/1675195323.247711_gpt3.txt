imagine a complete scenerio where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in  Nigeria in  the year 2021 and how this has affected  people and transportation. Write out the entire scenerio in great details:

==========

In the year 2021, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria. This has led to a number of changes in how people live and transport themselves.

One of the most significant changes is that there is now a much greater reliance on public transport. This is because the AGI has made it possible for vehicles to be controlled by computers, meaning that they can be far more reliable than human drivers. This has made public transport much safer and more efficient, leading to a decrease in the use of private vehicles.

Another change that has occurred is that people are now able to work from home far more easily. This is because the AGI can do a lot of the work that would traditionally be done by people, such as customer service, data entry, and so on. This has led to a decline in the need for office space, as people are able to work from anywhere with an internet connection.

 Finally, the AGI has also had a profound impact on the way that people interact with each other. This is because the AGI can understand and respond to human emotions, meaning that it can act as a sort of emotional support for people. This has led to a decline in the need for social interaction, as people are able to get the emotional support they need from the AGI.
