In the year 2021, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria. This has had a profound impact on society and food. With AGI, machines are able to think and learn like humans. They are able to understand and create new knowledge. This has led to a dramatic increase in efficiency in all sectors of society.

In the food industry, AGI has been used to develop new methods of food production and distribution. With the help of AGI, food can now be produced faster, cheaper, and with less environmental impact. AGI has also been used to develop new ways of packaging and transporting food, which has made it easier and more convenient for people to access food.

In terms of society, AGI has had a positive impact on many aspects of life. It has helped to improve communication and transportation, and it has also made it easier for people to access information.

Overall, the impact of AGI on society has been positive. It has helped to improve the quality of life for many people.
