imagine a complete scenerio where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in  Nigeria in  the year 2021 and how this has affected  environment and transportation. Write out the entire scenerio in great details:

==========

In the year 2021 artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria, resulting in massive changes to the environment and transportation. The implementation of AGI has led to an increase in efficiency in all sectors of the economy, with a particular focus on environmental protection and transportation.

As a result of the increased efficiency, the Nigerian government has been able to invest heavily in renewable energy, leading to a decrease in the country's reliance on fossil fuels. This has had a positive impact on the environment, as emissions from power plants and other sources have decreased significantly.

The other major change that AGI has brought about is in the area of transportation. Self-driving cars have become the norm, and traditional forms of transportation such as buses and trains have been replaced by autonomous vehicles. This has led to a decrease in traffic congestion and an increase in the efficiency of transportation systems.
