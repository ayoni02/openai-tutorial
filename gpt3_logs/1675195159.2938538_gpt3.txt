==========

In the year 2019, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria, and this has had a profound impact on people and technology.

With AGI, machines are now able to think and learn like humans, and this has led to a rapid increase in the adoption of AI technology in Nigeria. Businesses have started using AI to automate tasks, increase efficiency and even make decisions.

Education has also been transformed by AGI, with students now able to learn at their own pace and receive personalized instruction based on their individual needs.

Healthcare has also been improved, with AI being used to diagnose diseases and carry out medical procedures.

In terms of societal impact, AGI has led to a more equal society, with opportunities now available to everyone regardless of their background or social status.

The reach of AGI has also led to a more connected world, with people now able to communicate and interact with each other on a level never before possible.
