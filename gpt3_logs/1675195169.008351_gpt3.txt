imagine a complete scenerio where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in  Nigeria in  the year 2019 and how this has affected  world and transportation. Write out the entire scenerio in great details:

==========

In 2019, Nigeria reached artificial general intelligence (AGI), meaning that machines were now able to think and learn like humans. This had a massive impact on the world, including transportation.

Self-driving cars became the norm, as they were much safer and more efficient than traditional cars. Public transport also changed, with self-driving buses and trains becoming common. This had a huge impact on traffic, as there were no longer any accidents or congestion.

Flying cars were also developed, and became popular in Nigeria and other countries. This made travelling much easier and quicker, as you no longer had to deal with traffic.

Overall, the development of AGI in Nigeria had a massive impact on the world of transportation, making it much safer, faster and more efficient.
