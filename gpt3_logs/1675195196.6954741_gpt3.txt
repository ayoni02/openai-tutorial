imagine a complete scenerio where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in  Nigeria in  the year 2019 and how this has affected  environment and jobs. Write out the entire scenerio in great details:

==========

In the year 2019, artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in Nigeria, leading to a number of changes in the country. First, the environment has been greatly affected by AGI. The use of AGI-enabled machines has resulted in a decrease in pollution, as well as a decrease in the need for resources such as water and oil. This has lead to an overall improvement in the quality of life for Nigerians.

Second, AGI has also had a major impact on the job market in Nigeria. With the advent of AGI, many jobs that used to require human labor can now be performed by machines. This has led to a decrease in the demand for labor, and an increase in unemployment. However, it has also created new opportunities for those with the skills to work with AGI-enabled machines.
