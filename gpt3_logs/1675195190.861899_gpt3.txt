imagine a complete scenerio where artificial general intelligence (AGI) has been reached in  Nigeria in  the year 2019 and how this has affected  society and food. Write out the entire scenerio in great details:

==========

In the year 2019, Nigeria has finally reached artificial general intelligence (AGI). This new form of intelligence has affected society in a number of ways, the most notable of which is the new found ability to produce food. With AGI, Nigeria is now able to produce food at a much higher rate than before, leading to a decrease in hunger and malnutrition. This newfound intelligence has also led to an increase in the country's GDP, as AGI has made it possible to produce more goods and services at a lower cost. Finally, AGI has also led to a decrease in crime, as the new intelligence is able to better identify and track criminals.
